\subsection{eHealth Ontario}

Throughout Ontario, there is a clear desire to bring healthcare into the digital age by using software to improve access to medical information. The province intends to use a service-oriented architecture to allow for the development of components (i.e. IAPs) that distribute information between systems using a standard protocol known as the Health Information Access Layer (HIAL). HIAL will act as ``the broker and mediator for information exchange, ensuring that all [software] abide[s] by a common set of rules'' \cite{b1}. The intention of the government is to have a comprehensive and secure electronic health record, that may be accessed by HIAL-supporting software. This software (i.e. IAPs) may be developed by any vendor to support any patient or healthcare professional as the vendor sees fit. A systems diagram of Ontario's future eHealth infrastructure can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:eHealth1} below.

\subsection{Talking with Paramedics}

In regards to software and hardware for EFRs, we talked to a number of paramedics about how technology can support and improve the care they provide. Currently, EFRs use software such as the system seen in figure~\ref{fig:iMed1} on page~\pageref{fig:iMed1}, to guide them through collecting data that may be important to a patients health. These systems are cumbersome, require time to fill, and are only as helpful as the information the paramedics manage to collect. Throughout our discussions, there was overwhelmingly interest in a system that could provide paramedics with patient medical history. \iffalse We discovered that any information provided to a paramedic is helpful, and can greatly improve the quality and speed of care. In general,\fi Our findings can be summarized with the following quote from paramedic Matt Sartor:

\blockquote{Nursing homes carry [transfer documents] that contain updated information on [a patient] such as: medications, allergies and diagnosed disorders; including say if they [have] had a stroke, or have dementia, and what level of cognition or communication is normal for them. This kind of information gives us as paramedics a tipping point for how we assess our patients, or how we expect to communicate with them or have them do the same with us. [This information] would be very helpful for anyone we meet. Even if it's only [medication] history and allergies, we can decipher a lot from that. Even recent visits to hospital gives us a pattern of problems with a patient.

Currently the hospital can scan their card and get all prior hospital visits and diagnoses on discharges, but it's not available or compact enough for [paramedics] to get. If somehow our laptop forms, which we have to manually input all information we can attain, could get the aforementioned information, it would largely influence our practice.
}

Matt went on to explain how there are several different documenting systems used by Paramedics in Ontario, and that none are standardized. A standard system, like the one we are developing, would improve the ability of professionals to work together, and provide patients with care.

As discussed, there currently exists no cumulative EHR in Ontario, and we are developing software based on the assumption that in the future an EHR will exist. The software we develop will be focused on handling, storing and presenting medical information, rather than how it will be acquired.

\subsection{Alternative Electronic Health Records}

In 2003 the World Health Organization (WHO) released a document outlining the possibility of implementing a medical information system using “smart cards”. They described how information stored on a card could be carried by patients, that when scanned, would allow professionals to see the patients medical history \cite{smartcard1}. This method of information retrieval has the medical history being stored on the card itself, which is incompatible with Ontario's future EHR infrastructure. Instead of storing medical information, we will be using health cards to identify patients and provide authentication to access a particular medical record.
