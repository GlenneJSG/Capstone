\section{Conclusion}

Throughout the development process, both the software and hardware will be tested to ensure it meets design requirements. In terms of software, each module will be verified using test cases that have known outcomes to ensure functionality. The hardware will be tested in a similar way, using test cases to verify the hardware meets specification.

An example of real-world testing that can be used is in verifying the pulse-sensing capabilites. The hardware can be tested on a group member with a known pulse (through traditional human pulse reading), to ensure that the device senses pulses correctly.
